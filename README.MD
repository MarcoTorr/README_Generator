  ## Description 

  Developed a tool that helps us to generate a README.MD file through adding information about our project in the command line.

  ## Installation 

  Requires npm, inquirer, fs and util installation.

  ## Usage 

  Open up terminal and navigate to the project folder, run "node index.js" and a series of questions will start to require your inputs (which will be used in the README.MD file, to fill the next inputs press enter. Each question must be answered and by the end it write Y if the information is correct or N if the information is incorrect. If correct, the READM.MD file will be generated with the information provided, if incorrect the process will start again until correct.
